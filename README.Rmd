# AlgoProximal

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of AlgoProximal is to **solve the LASSO regression problem**using the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm

## Installation

You can install the development version of AlgoProximal like so:

``` r
# Ensure that you have all the developping tools
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install("C:\Users\OURBANI IBRAHIMA\Desktop\Dossier et Codes R\AlgoProximal")
# Alternatively,if you use Rstudio:
# Build >Install and Restart
```
## Methodology:L'algorithme ISTA

The package solve the objectif function of LASSO,$$J(\beta)=f(\beta) +g(\beta)$$

1.**Smooth Part(Loss step gradient) :**Minimisation of the least squares error by alternating two steps

$$\tilde{\beta} = \beta^k -\gamma \nabla f(\beta^k)$$

2. **Non smooth part(Proximal operator) :**Application of the ** soft thresholding operation**

The key fonctions to implement are :'grad_loss','calculate_lipschitz_const()','prox_l1()'.



## Example

This is how create a LASSO modele and obtain their coefficients

```{r example}
# Charge the package and its fonctions
library(devtools)
load_all()
# If the package is in R; install:library(AlgoProximal)

# 1.Simulation of data(4 predictors,the two last are Zeros)
set.seed(123)
N <- 100
P <- 4
X <- matrix(rnorm(N *P),N ,P)
y <- X%*% c(3,-2,0,0) + rnorm(N,0,0.5)

# 2.Define the regularisation parameter
lambda_test <- 0.2

# 3.Execution of the ISTA solver
# max_iter and tol are fixed to ensure convergence
resultat_lasso <- ista_lasso(X=X,
                             y=y,
                             lambda=lambda_test,
                             max_iter=5000,
                             tol=1e-4)

#Paste the obtained coefficients
cat(" Predicts coefficients( the third and forth must be close to zero) :\n ")
print(round(resultat_lasso$coefficients,4))


```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
